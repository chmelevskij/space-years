#The task

We need you to programme a space age calculator.

Don’t worry, it’s not a system for dating a captain’s log. In fact, the task couldn’t be simpler.

Given a person’s age, calculate how old that person would be on different planets.

For simplicity’s sake, here’s a list of planets and their orbit times.

Earth: Orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds
Mercury: Orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
Venus: Orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
Mars: Orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
Jupiter: Orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
Saturn: Orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
Uranus: Orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
Neptune: Orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
And, depending on your feelings towards Pluto...
Pluto: Orbital period 248.00 Earth years
So, if you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth years old.

Rules

There are no rules.

Use any programming language you like, or even one you dislike. If you're not confident with a programming language, send us the algorithm you'd use to do this written in pseudo code.

How do I submit my amazing creation?

Once you have a completed solution, please submit your technical test as an attachment to hackday@arnoldclark.com, along with any notes required to run your program.

How long do I have to build my space age calculator?

The closing date for submissions is Monday 16th October at 11pm.

What happens next?

A programmer from Arnold Clark will review your application.
We'll let you know if you've been accepted for the Hack Day.
You’ll hear back from us by Monday 30th October if you have been successful.
If you’ve got any questions, please contact hackday@arnoldclark.com.

We’re really looking forward to seeing your awesome solution! Good luck!
